## Motivation
 Methylation is the most frequently occurring epigenetic modification accounting for over 50% of the total modification forms. Among these methylation
sites in the adenosine nucleobase, N1-methyladenosine (1mA) is a significant posttranscriptional alteration found in myriad types of RNA molecules. Many 
experimental techniques were developed to determine 1mA in RNA sequences with improved sensitivity. These approaches, however, are not cost-and-time-effective 
solutions for wide screening in low-budget labs. To partially address this problem, severalcomputational methods were introduced to assist experimental scientists 
in identifying 1mA sites. In our study, we propose a more effective computational model called iR1mA-LSTM to predict 1mA sites in human transcriptomes using the 
bidirectional Long Short-term Memory networks enhanced by attention mechanism to improve the predictive power. 

## Results
We conducted repeated experiments to fairly estimate the robustness and stability of the model performance and benchmarked our method with other
methods on the same independent test set. The results showed that iR1mA-LSTM outperformed other methods with both the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve and the area under the precision-recall curve values of 0.99.
